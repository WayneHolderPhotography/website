i like this site http://kristianlevenphotography.co.uk/

yes 
so say i do a shoot in client area i want to have their images\link they click on and have to enter a password or a guest password
like thsi http://paulrogers.zenfolio.com/client-galleries

i want images to be able to fill screen as much as possible for what ever screen size


this is my existing site http://www.shotbywayne.uk/index.html


this is the difficult part
I am trying to break into wedding photography but haven't done any yet so see from my website now www.shotbywayne.uk its mainly portraits and fashion
so i want this to be more aimed as portraits and wedding/events
so i could have an event theme and portraits then change it later onnce i do more weddings?
not sure what do you think
I also need to find another host
